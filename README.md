# Simulation-Loto

This is a really basic french Loto simulation I coded just to see if I would be able to do it. Feel free to make any comment or feedback on my code as I am still learning !

This Loto works as so : 

You chose five different numbers between 1 and 49, this is your grid.
Your numbers are compared to 5 randomly generated "grid", composed of 5 numbers between 1 and 49.
If your grid correspond to any of the random grid, you won ! Otherwise, you lose.
